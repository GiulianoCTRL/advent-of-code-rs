/* Each board 5x5
Input
    - bingo input: [X]
        - first line is ,-separated bingo inputâ‰ˆ
    - bingo boards: [X]
        - boards separated by empty line
        - numbers in board separated by single ' '
Processing of input: [X]
    - bingo input into vector
    - boards into 3D vector -> board[line[number]]
Selecting winning board
    - loop through each number and check if number has been called
    - lookup table with bool = number has been marked (init with false)
    - if value of all bools in line is true, break loop and select board
Result
    - pop number from bingo input number (to later return it when loop breaks)
    - sum of all unmarked numbers on board multiplied by last called number (false in lookup)
        - each value that is false shall be summed (.reduce with .filter)
